This is the repository of documentation for hardware that has been decertified from the OSHWA open source hardware certification process.  OSHWA tries to archive hardware documentation as part of the certification process.  If a project falls out of compliance with the certification requirements, and OSHWA has archived documentation on that project, it is added here as part of the decertification process.  

You can learn more about the OSHWA open source hardware certification process at https://certification.oshwa.org/.
